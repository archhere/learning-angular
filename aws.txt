Amazon has many data centers. Each of these data center regions have availability
zones. This is so, if one zone fails, the others work. So our service is always online.
This is important, bcoz we can choose which zone we want to host our server in.

All Services
You pick the service you want and use it to solve your specific problem.

Traditional                        |                           Serverless

Provision capacity                                       Runs on Demand
How much server capacity?                                Unlimited capacity (Only pay for code execution)
CPU, RAM, MEMORY                                         Scales automatically (pay what you need)
Update OS                                                Runs on managed AWS infrastructure
Lots of overhead                                         Code runs in uptodate environment. Great for SPA and APIs
Great support for full stack apps


Start:

1) search api gateway
2) click on "get started"
3) select new Api
4) Give it any name and hit create API
This will create API for you.
Lambda is just a code on demand thing.
There are advanced ways of creating API, for eg by importing API definition files.
But we are focussing on basics here.

5) Click on actions and "Create Resource". For Resource Name, we can give any name
"first-api-test" and hit "create Resource"

6) We cant use the resource yet.
Lets go to actions and click "create Method."
In this case, lets choose GET.Click tick mark. Now select  "mock", click save.
Now you have created your first API end point.You will see request and response. Go to "Integration response" and click on downward arrow here.In Body Mapping template, application /json.

{"message": "This is working"}
Now save and go to actions, deploy api.
In staging, you can add dev,as this is under development. This would generate an url, open the url with api end point, first-api-test. You would get the json indicated above.
